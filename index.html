		I'm a third-year PhD student in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I work with professors Bilge Mutlu, Aws Albarghouthi, and Allison Sauppé in applying formal methods to human-robot interaction design. I am currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.<br><br>

		Prior to my graduate studies, I attended the University of Arizona for my undergraduate degree. As an undergraduate I worked with Dr. E. Fiona Bailey in the Physiology Department to record and analyze neuromuscular activity, Dr. Joanna Masel in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department to assist developing computational models of evolution, and Dr. John Kececioglu in the Computer Science Department to develop a novel method for protein secondary structure prediction.<br><br>
