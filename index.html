		I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, working on social robotics and formal methods. Specifically, I create tools and techniques that help people program social robots. I work with professors Bilge Mutlu, Aws Albarghouthi, and Allison Sauppé, and I am currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.<br><br>

		Prior to my graduate studies, I attended the University of Arizona for my undergraduate degree. As an undergraduate I worked with Dr. E. Fiona Bailey in the Physiology Department to record and analyze neuromuscular activity, Dr. Joanna Masel in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department to assist developing computational models of evolution, and Dr. John Kececioglu in the Computer Science Department to develop a novel method for protein secondary structure prediction.<br><br>
